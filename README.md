With high-dimensional omics features, repeated measure ANOVA leads to longitudinal gene-environment interaction studies that have intra-cluster correlations, outlying observations and structured sparsity arising from the ANOVA design. In this package, we have developed robust sparse Bayesian mixed effect models tailored for the above studies ([Fan et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssc/qlaf027)). An efficient Gibbs sampler has been developed to facilitate fast computation. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods are efficiently implemented in 'C++'. The development of this software package and the associated statistical methods have been partially supported by an Innovative Research Award from Johnson Cancer Research Center, Kansas State University.

## How to install

  - To install from github, run these two lines of code in R

<!-- end list -->

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("kunfa/mixedBayes")

  - Released versions of mixedBayes are available on CRAN
    [(link)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mixedBayes), and can be
    installed within R via

## Examples

#### Example.1 (default method: robust sparse bi-level selection under random intercept -and- slope model)

    library(mixedBayes)
    data(data)
    
    fit = mixedBayes(y,e,X,g,w,k,structure=c("bi-level"))
    fit$coefficient
    b = selection(fit,sparse=TRUE)
    index = which(coeff!=0)
    pos = which(b != 0)
    tp = length(intersect(index, pos))
    fp = length(pos) - tp
    list(tp=tp, fp=fp)
#### Example.2 (alternative: robust sparse individual level selection under random intercept -and- slope model)

    fit = mixedBayes(y,e,X,g,w,k,structure=c("individual"))
    fit$coefficient
    b = selection(fit,sparse=TRUE)
    index = which(coeff!=0)
    pos = which(b != 0)
    tp = length(intersect(index, pos))
    fp = length(pos) - tp
    list(tp=tp, fp=fp)

#### Example.3 (alternative: non-robust sparse bi-level selection under random intercept -and- slope model)

    fit = mixedBayes(y,e,X,g,w,k,robust=FALSE, structure=c("bi-level"))
    fit$coefficient
    b = selection(fit,sparse=TRUE)
    index = which(coeff!=0)
    pos = which(b != 0)
    tp = length(intersect(index, pos))
    fp = length(pos) - tp
    list(tp=tp, fp=fp)
#### Example.4 (alternative: robust sparse bi-level selection under random intercept model)
    fit = mixedBayes(y,e,X,g,w,k,slope=FALSE, structure=c("bi-level"))
    fit$coefficient    
    b = selection(fit,sparse=TRUE)
    index = which(coeff!=0)
    pos = which(b != 0)
    tp = length(intersect(index, pos))
    fp = length(pos) - tp
    list(tp=tp, fp=fp)
