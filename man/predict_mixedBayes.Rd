\title{Make predictions from a mixedBayes object}
\usage{
predict_mixedBayes(object, y, X, e, g, w, k, slope, loss)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a mixedBayes object.}

\item{y}{a numeric vector of repeated-measure responses in long format. The observations
should be stacked in the same order as the rows of X, e, g, and w.
The current version only supports continuous response.}

\item{X}{the long-format design matrix for fixed effects, including an intercept and optionally
time-related covariates.}

\item{e}{the long-format design matrix for environment/treatment effects. In many applications,
this is a set of dummy variables encoding treatment levels.}

\item{g}{the long-format matrix of genetic predictors (main effects) without an intercept.}

\item{w}{the long-format matrix of gene-environment interaction terms. Typically, each row
of w is constructed from the corresponding rows of g and e (e.g., via a Kronecker product),
so that interaction terms represent products of genetic predictors with environment/treatment
covariates.}

\item{k}{integer. Number of repeated measurements per subject.}

\item{slope}{logical flag. If TRUE, random intercept-and-slope model will be used.}

\item{loss}{character string specifying the prediction loss function.
"L1" for mean absolute error;
"L2" for mean squared error.}
}
\value{
an object of class `mixedBayes.pred' is returned, which is a list with components:
\item{pred_error}{prediction error.}
\item{y_hat}{predicted values of the repeated measured responses.}
